# Assignment overview

Under `/layout` you will find the PSD file for your current assignment. 

The goal is to verify your ability to code an interactive UI from scratch.

Please, follow these guidelines:

- Use React / SASS / Gulp
- Implement various button states labeled “Pressed”	and “Hover” inside the PSD file
- Implement various input field states; please note that in PSD file:
-- ”Your name” is in `hover` state
-- “Password” is in `default` state
-- “Email address” is in `error` state after validate failed
- Implement custom checkbox for “Sesso” and for “Privacy Policy”

We suggest to avoid using any images (apart from background) and to implement transitions between input field states.

Commit early and often.
